					At 19 years old entering into university to study Biomedical Toxicology BSc, Mackenzie joined her student body orginization as Finance Minister but more importantly Desiger. She started using Adobe Illistartor to create new designs that were immediatly scraped by the the other members. Instead everyone opted for some jerkâ€™s logo created by an online logo generator. Devistated by this one particular insident and no other reasons, she left univeristy.

She desgined three websites with the help of Google and redesigned their company brandings as well. Successfully? No, but back then - of freaking course!
